# RRAEs

This repository contains all the necessary codes for training and using RRAEs. The library contains multiple classes for different types of Autoencoders (including RRAEs, IRMAEs, LoRAEs, and Vanilla, all with both MLPs and CNNs). 

### ⚠️ Warning ⚠️: For now, CNNs are not stable, if you need to use them let me know in advance.
