# RRAEs

Hello Paco, Chady, Sebastian,

This repository contains all the work done on RRAEs. You can find the paper [here](tex_folder/papier-shifted-curve.pdf) (to download, click on raw).

If we are to publish our codes to the public, I will write some documentation with some examples here, and remove all unnecessary materials (e.g. folders for training IRMAE, LoRAE).
